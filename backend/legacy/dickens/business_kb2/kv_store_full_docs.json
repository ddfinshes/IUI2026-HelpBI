When users input data related to it, they might only enter 'week ww'. In such cases, we need to append an appropriate four- digit year ('yyyy') to form the complete 'week id'. There is a specific rule for determining this year. If the current date falls within the period from April 1st to December 31st, we should use the year of the current date plus 1. For example, if today's date is in this range in 2024, we would use 2025 for the year part when constructing the 'week id'. On the other hand, if the current date is between January 1st and March 31st, we should use the year of the current date itself. For instance, if today is within this range in 2025, we would use 2025 for the year part when forming the 'week id'. Please keep this rule in mind when processing any input related to 'week id' to ensure accurate results. \n\n2.***Explanation on Stores：\n- China: Refers to mainland China, country=mainland In Database.\n- CN: Refers to mainland China, country=mainland In Database.\n- Mainland: Refers to mainland China, country=mainland In Database.\n- APAC: Refers to region='APAC'.\n- Store Status: Status of the store opening or closing: open/closed.\n- Store Name: Name of the store.\ne.g.,\nEC- Brand SITE/\nEC- TMALL/\nVIP STORE 2/\nWXLIVESHOP/\nUA Korea/\nUA Korea Employee/\nNaver Smartstore/\nEC- JD/\nEC- TMALL Outlet/\nVIP JITX STORE/\nEC- Mini- program/\nCoupang/\nTiktok Store/\nTiktok Female Store/\nKaKao Gift/\nEC- FQL/\nPDD/\nKaKao Deal/\nCHINA TIKTOK SPORTS/\nHK/\n11ST/\nVIP/\nG- market/\nXIAOHONGSHU.\n- platform:In the EC (E- commerce) channel, \"platform\" refers to the store name of the e- commerce store. \n- Channel: Channel where the store belongs.For example, :EC/FP/O&O.\nEC: E- commerce,the channel is EC.\nFP: Distributor,the channel is FP.\nO&O: Retail store.the channel is O&O.\n\"Retail\" refers to retail stores, that is, O&O stores.
