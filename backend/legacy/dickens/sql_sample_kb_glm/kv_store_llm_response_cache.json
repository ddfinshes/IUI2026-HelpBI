The column that stores the target or goal amount for each day/period.\n4. If there is any specific product category, channel, etc., that you are interested in comparing.\n\nAssuming we have a table named `sales` with columns `sale_date`, `amount_sold`, and `target_amount`, and we want to calculate the total sales (`total_sales`) compared to the total target amount (`total_target`) for the current week-to-date (WTD), here is an example of how you could write this query:\n\n```sql\nWITH wtd_sales AS (\n    SELECT SUM(amount_sold) AS total_sales,\n           SUM(target_amount) AS total_target\n    FROM sales\n    WHERE sale_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 week' -- Start of the current week\n      AND sale_date < CURRENT_DATE -- Up to, but not including, today's date\n),\ntarget_info AS (\n    SELECT SUM(target_amount) AS weekly_target\n    FROM target_table -- Assuming there is a separate table with targets for each day/week\n    WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 week' -- Start of the current week\n      AND date < CURRENT_DATE -- Up to, but not including, today's date\n)\nSELECT\n    wtd_sales.total_sales,\n    wtd_sales.total_target,\n    (wtd_sales.total_sales - COALESCE(target_info.weekly_target, 0)) AS difference\nFROM wtd_sales, LATERAL target_info; -- Use LATERAL to handle the case where there might not be a target for some days\n```\n\nThis query does the following:\n\n- In the `wtd_sales` common table expression (CTE), it calculates the total sales and the total target for the current WTD.\n- In the `target_info` CTE, it retrieves the weekly target amount from a hypothetical `target_table`.\n- The final `SELECT` statement calculates the difference between the total sales and the total target. It uses `LATERAL` to allow us to join the two CTEs even if there are days without a corresponding target in the `target_table`.\n\nPlease note that you need to replace `sales`, `amount_sold`, `target_amount`, and `target_table` with the actual names of your tables and columns.

This calculation results in a percentage with two decimal places, indicating how much of the target sales has been achieved.\n\n2. **Querying Sales and Targets**: The SQL queries demonstrate how to retrieve data on sales and their respective targets. For instance, querying by store code or name allows for specific insights into individual store performance (Chunk 22).\n\n3. **Store-Specific Queries**: If you want to know how a particular store's sales compare to its target, you can use the SQL query provided in Chunk 22. This query filters data based on date and store identification.\n\n4. **Grouping by Gender for Sales Units**: For a more detailed analysis, you might also group sales units by gender (Chunk 11). This would help in understanding the distribution of sales across different demographics.\n\n5. **Comparing Store Sales to Country Channel Average**: To assess how a specific store's performance compares with the country channel average, Chunk 16 provides an SQL query that calculates the store's sales share within its respective country channel.\n\nBy utilizing these queries and concepts, you can effectively analyze WTD (week-to-date) sales versus target.
