- week id: represented by a six- digit number in the format of 'yyyyww'. When users input data related to it, they might only enter 'week ww'. In such cases, we need to append an appropriate four- digit year ('yyyy') to form the complete 'week id'. There is a specific rule for determining this year. If the current date falls within the period from April 1st to December 31st, we should use the year of the current date plus 1. For example, if today's date is in this range in 2024, we would use 2025 for the year part when constructing the 'week id'. On the other hand, if the current date is between January 1st and March 31st, we should use the year of the current date itself. For instance, if today is within this range in 2025, we would use 2025 for the year part when forming the 'week id'. Please keep this rule in mind when processing any input related to 'week id' to ensure accurate results.
- You can use the following SQL text to get today's weekid:  select week_id from chatbi_dim_calendar where date_code =CURRENT_DATE

- Gender: Gender attribute of the product, e.g., MENS, WOMENS, BOYS, GIRLS, Unisex.

- Season code: The "season code" refers to two distinct concepts: the season in which a sale occurs (sales season) and the season associated with the product itself (product season).
    
    Each year is divided into two seasons: the first half (January to June) is denoted as "SS" followed by the year, where "SS" stands for Spring and Summer, such as SS23 or SS24. The second half (July to December) is denoted as "FW" followed by the year, where "FW" stands for Fall and Winter, such as FW23 or FW24.
    
    For example, if an item is purchased in March 2025, the sales season would be SS25. The product season, however, refers to the season for which the item was designed or intended for sale. If this item is a new Spring 2025 product, its product season would be SS25 (not FW25 as stated in the original; this seems to be a correction based on context). When the sales season and product season align (e.g., both are SS25), the item is considered "in-season." Conversely, if the item is an older product with a product season of SS24, but it’s sold in SS25, it would be classified as "off-season."
    
    In the product sales table, the "season_code" field specifically stores the product season, not the sales season.
